# React Router v6 useParams Hook Error Outside Route Component

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useParams` hook in React Router v6. The error occurs when attempting to use `useParams` outside of a component rendered within a `Route` or `Routes` element.

The solution involves restructuring the code to access `useParams` only within the appropriate component context.
